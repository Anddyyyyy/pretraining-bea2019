# Neural GEC Systems with Unsupervised Pre-Training on Synthetic Data

This repository contains models, system configurations and outputs of our
winning GEC systems in [the BEA 2019 shared
task](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/nl/bea2019st/) described in R.

## Content

- `systems` - original GEC systems developed for and submitted to the
  restricted and low-resource tracks
- `outputs` - corrected output and evaluation scores for common GEC test sets
- `training` - updated training scripts re-producing our GEC system

See _README_ files in each subdirectory for more information.  In case of any
questions, please open an issue or send me (Roman) an email.
