# Neural GEC Systems with Unsupervised Pre-Training on Synthetic Data

This repository contains models, system configurations and outputs of our
winning GEC systems in [the BEA 2019 shared
task](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/nl/bea2019st/) described in R.
Grundkiewicz, M. Junczys-Dowmunt, K. Heafield: Neural Grammatical Error
Correction Systems with Unsupervised Pre-training on Synthetic Data, BEA 2019.

This is under construction and should contain useful information around the
time of ACL 2019 in July.
